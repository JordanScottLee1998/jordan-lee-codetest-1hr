Hi!

Find here my attempt at your codetest

I feel like I got the good portion of the UI looking correct as per the figma however the spacing is a bit off. In particular if I had more time I would:
1. alter the sizing so that each article is a bit 'off-line' as it is in the Figma. Right now in my test everything is completely inline which isn't as the design is
2. alter the text size, styling and spacing. The font is not the one provided which would need to change. In addition some of the spacing is a bit off compared to the designs, particularly the categories are larger and aligned differently than the design
3. Clean up some of the CSS! Some best practice went to the way side so I didn't go too far over time. In particular I used the * selector a few times which is a bit of a no-no

I didn't quite get all the tasks completed. I got the data reading in from the API provided however I wasn't able to do anything with the data in the time provided. If I had the time the next steps I would take with this data would be:
1. Create a JS class for the data objects and create objects for each article given by the API
2. Create an algorithm to determine which type of 'tile' (lg, md, sm, ex-sm as I labelled them in my code) the article should be displayed as. As far as I could tell this is determined by the articles content and not a variable though I could have missed this in the API data
3. Append articles to the Grid

Hope it is to your standards! Look forward to chatting to you soon

Regards,
Jordan Lee
